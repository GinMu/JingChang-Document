At present, the embrace of blockchain and business is getting faster and faster, and various applications are emerging endlessly. It is no longer a geek toy in the community, but various industries to explore and practice how blockchain technology is applied in business.

According to the characteristics of the financial industry, this manual explains how to deploy SWTC blockchain, how to interface with the legacy systems in the financial industry, and how to deploy and implement banking business based on blockchain technology now and in the future.

This article is based on a lot of information provided by [SWTC Foundation](http://www.swtc.top/), and I would like to express my gratitude.
